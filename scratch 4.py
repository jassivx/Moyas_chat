          "aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and "
          "raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent "
          "the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development "
          "Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian "
          "space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India "
          "for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal "
          "organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original "
          "nuclear test by India in 1974.[5] Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the "
          "ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the People's President,[6] "
          "he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several "
          "prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the Indian "
          "Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] "
          "Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was "
          "buried with full state honours.")
